# ObjMtl_Separator
Using an OBJ's MTL file, this program will create multiple OBJ's (one per material).
This program was created solely because Roblox studio cannot import MTL files, and this was the best solution I could think of.

Using my amazing artistic abilities, I have created an image showcasing what this process looks like

Since you're also wondering how the program works, let me show you:

* The squares are all buttons.
* the MTL / OBJ buttons are for selecting the respective files.
* the Output Directory will select where you want your designated OBJ's to put created.
* If not output directory is selected, it will try to output them in a folder called "data" next to your executable.
* Additionally, a txt will be created next to your OBJ's that will output the diffuse RGB colors of each material.

This program was also created using Processing (Java), not for any particular reason other than I know how to use it.
Anyways, use this program responsibly please.
